## Overview

I have created a Discord bot that interacts with my iRacing Statistics database. The bot allows users to access a range of statistical information about iRacing Series and Drivers.

You can click this link to [join the iRacing Stats Discord server](https://irstatsbot.fuzzwah.com/discord) where the bot will respond to commands in the **#bot-playground** channel. Feel free to check out your own stats for the current season using the `!driver Your Name` command. Below is an example of the type of information that the bot will respond with:

![!driver](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/658935/100395468-255c5300-3095-11eb-8d52-dbfa5f1a7d5c.png)

Typing `!help` in the channel will have the bot private message you with a breif explanation of all the available commands.

You can [check out screenshots](screenshots.html) of the output from some of the other commands.

## Adding the bot to your Discord

The bot also has a range of features that support iRacing teams and communities. It is possible to add the bot to your own Discord server and configure a list of drivers to automatically include in the output of the various commands.

I have set up a Patreon page to allow people to subscribe to help cover the costs involved with running the bot.

## Individual subscribers

There are also a number of subcriber only commands that can any public Discord server, such as the iRacing Stats Discord, iRacing Open Wheel Hub, iRacing Chat, GermanSimRacing.de, and CTC Lotus 79.

The bot will highlight the subscribed driver in various outputs, as shown in the [screenshots](screenshots.html)].
