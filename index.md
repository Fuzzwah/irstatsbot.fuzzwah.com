## Overview

I have created a Discord bot that interacts with my iRacing Statistics database. The bot allows users to access a range of statistical information about iRacing Series and Drivers.

You can use this [Discord invite link](https://discord.gg/AFW8BDm) to join the iRacing Stats Discord where the bot will respond to commands in the #bot-commands channel. Feel free to check out your own stats for the current season using the `!driver Your Name` command. Typing `!help` in the channel will have the bot private message you with a breif explanation of all the available commands.
